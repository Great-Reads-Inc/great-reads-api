# Development Strategy for Great Reads Inc.

## 1. Project Overview
The "Great Reads" application aims to provide users with a platform to track books they have read, wish to read, and are currently reading. It will include features for adding, removing, rating, reviewing, and viewing book details, as well as browsing and discovering top-rated books.

## 2. Initial Infrastructure Setup
The first critical step is to establish the foundational development environment.
*   **Docker Compose**: Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file within the `great-reads-infrastructure` directory. This file will define three core services:
    *   `db`: A PostgreSQL database service.
    *   `api`: The Python/Django backend service.
    *   `client`: The JavaScript/TypeScript/React frontend service.
*   **Database Service Configuration**: Configure the PostgreSQL service in `docker-compose.yaml` with appropriate environment variables for the database name, user, and password, as outlined in the `projectbrief.md`.
*   **API Service Dockerfile**: Create a `Dockerfile` for the `great-reads-api` service to containerize the Django application.

## 3. Database Schema Implementation
Once the PostgreSQL database service is defined in Docker Compose, the next step is to implement the database schema.
*   **DBML to SQL Translation**: Translate the provided DBML schema in `projectbrief.md` into executable SQL commands or Django model definitions.
*   **Initial Migrations**: For the Django API, create initial database migrations to set up the tables as defined in the schema.

## 4. Core API Development (Django)
With the infrastructure and database schema in place, development of the `great-reads-api` can begin.
*   **Django Project Setup**: Initialize a Django project and app(s) within the `great-reads-api` directory.
*   **Model Definitions**: Implement Django models corresponding to the tables defined in the DBML (Book, Author, Genre, User, SavedBook, Status).
*   **Basic CRUD Endpoints**: Develop initial API endpoints for the MVP features, starting with basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for core entities like Books and Users.

## 5. Version Control
*   Ensure the project is under version control (Git) from the outset, with a clear branching strategy for development.
